            <p>Learn how to use VerifyAI effectively to verify photos and protect yourself online.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-section">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Upload a Photo</h3>
            <p>There are two ways to analyze a photo in VerifyAI:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From within the app:</strong> Tap the upload button and select a photo from your device</li>
                <li><strong>Share from other apps:</strong> Use the "Share" option in messaging apps, email, or web browsers to send photos directly to VerifyAI</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Wait for Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                VerifyAI will automatically begin analyzing the photo using multiple search engines.
                You'll see progress indicators showing which engines have completed their analysis.
                Most analyses complete within 10-30 seconds.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Review Results</h3>
            <p>
                Once analysis is complete, you'll see one of four risk assessments along with detailed information
                about where the photo was found online.

                    The photo was found in commercial stock photo libraries (like Shutterstock).
                    This is a strong indicator that the photo may not be of the person you're talking to.

                    The photo appears in multiple places online with exact matches.
                    This could indicate the photo has been copied and used by multiple people.

                    Similar photos were found, but they're not exact matches.
                    This could be coincidental or could indicate the same person in different photos.

            <h2>Understanding Result Details</h2>

            <h3>Source Categories</h3>
            <p>Results are organized into categories to help you understand where photos were found:</p>

            <h4>Exact Matches</h4>
            <p>
                Photos that are identical or nearly identical to the one you uploaded.
                These are the most reliable indicators.
            </p>

            <h4>Similar Matches</h4>
            <p>
                Photos that look similar but may have differences in cropping, filtering, or quality.
                These should be reviewed carefully.
            </p>

            <h3>Source Types</h3>
            <p>Pay attention to badges indicating where photos were found:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Found on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Stock Photos:</strong> Found in commercial photo libraries (HIGH RISK)</li>

            <h3>Priority Sorting</h3>
            <p>
                Results are automatically sorted to show the most relevant information first:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stock photo sources (highest priority - major risk indicator)</li>
                <li>Social media sources (high priority - often most relevant)</li>
                <li>Other web sources (lower priority)</li>
            </ol>

                <li>You've never video called or met in person</li>
