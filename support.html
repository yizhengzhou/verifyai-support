            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I use VerifyAI?</h3>
                <p>
                    Simply upload a photo through the app or share it from another app. VerifyAI will analyze
                    the photo using AI-powered face detection and search across multiple engines. You'll receive
                    results within seconds showing if and where the photo appears online.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does VerifyAI protect my privacy?</h3>
                <p>
                    We take privacy very seriously. Your photos are only temporarily stored during the analysis
                    process and are <strong>permanently deleted immediately after analysis completes</strong>.
                    We never archive, backup, or permanently store any of your uploaded images.
                    For more details, please see our <a href="privacy-policy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long does analysis take?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most analyses complete within 10-30 seconds, depending on the complexity of the photo
                    and current server load. You'll see real-time progress updates as different search
                    engines complete their analysis.

                <h3>How do I interpret the results?</h3>
                <p>
                    VerifyAI provides one of four risk assessments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Risk:</strong> Photo found in commercial stock photo libraries</li>
                    <li><strong>Suspicious:</strong> Photo appears in multiple exact matches across different sources</li>
                    <li><strong>Uncertain:</strong> Similar photos found, but may be coincidental</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean:</strong> No matches found in any search engine</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For detailed guidance, visit our <a href="user-guide.html">User Guide</a>.

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why does the app need certain permissions?</h3>
                <p>
                    VerifyAI requests the following permissions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> To allow you to select photos for analysis</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> To take new photos for immediate analysis (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We only access photos you explicitly select or take within the app. We never access
                    your entire photo library without your permission.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if the analysis shows my photo is being used elsewhere?</h3>
                <p>
                    If VerifyAI finds your photo being used by someone else, this could indicate:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone may have copied your photo from your social media</li>
                    <li>The photo was shared without your knowledge</li>
                    <li>In some cases, it could be a false positive</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We recommend reviewing the sources carefully and considering whether you want to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact the platform where the photo appears</li>
                    <li>Report unauthorized use</li>
                    <li>Adjust your privacy settings on social media</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Remember: VerifyAI provides information to help you make informed decisions.
                    The final decision is always yours.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I analyze multiple photos at once?</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, VerifyAI analyzes one photo at a time to ensure accurate results and maintain
                    fast processing speeds. We may add batch analysis in future updates.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What types of photos work best?</h3>
                <p>
                    VerifyAI works best with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear, well-lit photos with visible faces</li>
                    <li>Single-person portraits</li>
                    <li>Photos where the face is not obscured</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Photos with multiple people, low quality, or heavily filtered images may produce
                    less accurate results.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is my data shared with third parties?</h3>
                <p>
                    To provide our service, we temporarily share photos with trusted analysis providers
                    (Google Cloud Vision, SerpAPI, Shutterstock) for the duration of the analysis only.
                    These services are bound by their own privacy policies. We never sell your data or
                    use it for advertising. See our <a href="privacy-policy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>
                    for complete details.

                <h3>How accurate is VerifyAI?</h3>
                <p>
                    VerifyAI uses multiple industry-leading search engines and AI technologies to provide
                    comprehensive results. However, no system is 100% accurate. Results should be considered
                    as one factor in your decision-making process, not the only factor.

                <h3>Will you add more features in the future?</h3>
